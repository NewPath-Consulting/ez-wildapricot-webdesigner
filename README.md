Wild Apricot Text Manager

This is a jQuery-based library to manage languages, modify hard coded labels and strings and add CSS-styling in Wild Apricot (www.wildapricot.com).

The management is done in a configuration file to make it easy to maintain a large amount of modifications and translations.
