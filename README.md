# Documentation

## Project Description

The [EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer](https://newpathconsulting.com/watm) \(aka WATM\) is a JavaScript library that is written using the [jQuery](https://www.jquery.org) framework included with every [WildApricot](https://wildapricot.com) website. EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer will help any administrator with some knowledge of the Document Object Model (DOM) manage and replace nearly every piece of hard-coded and configurable text in Wild Apricot. You can make a variety of changes such as global search and replace of a particular text string or modify field labels on forms, buttons labels, hard coded warning boxes. The module enables changing properties of any Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\) class or CSS ID or path. You can also hide text, labels or buttons. The module can be used to make Wild Apricot sites bi-lingual by dynamically replacing strings with a translated string. EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer uses a comma separated value (CSV)-formatted configuration file that is easily editable, making it easy to maintain hundreds of modifications in a human-readable file.

The configuration file must be saved in UTF-8 format, and it must be named `wildapricot-textmanager-config.csv`.

### Browser Based CSS Inspector

After successful installation, go to the public view of your Wild Apricot website, and  add `?dev` into the URL. This will switch EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer into a "development" mode. You can then click on any element on the page to inspect its CSS naming properties.

There are 3 potential values that will show up when you click on any element on a page:
- the [Element ID](https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_id.asp)
- the CSS Path
- the [Element Class(es)](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.asp).

#### Element ID
An Element ID is unique per web page and identifies a particlar object on a web page. IDs always have a `#` at the beginning of the name and appear in the optional `id` attribute of an element. The `id` attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. An example ID is `#mytable`. Using the Element ID is the most specific and usually the most accurate way to target a particular element on a page. Unfortunately not all elements in a WildApricot page have an `id` but many do.

#### CSS Path
The CSS Path also can define a particular element using a "chain" of HTML elements. A CSS Path describes an elememt in relation to other elements that contain the specific element so it can be composed of a combination of several tags. A CSS path is precise definition of an element that may be nested within multiple elements. Note that a CSS Path can change if the order of elements on a page are added or removed. As a result a CSS Path can "mutate" due to the configuration of a Wild Apricot database for example. If an Element ID is not available a CSS path can be be used instead.

#### Element Class
An Element class describes one or more CSS classes applied to the element. A class can be used by multiple HTML elements, so as a result it is the least specific of all targets. Use he element class when you wish to apply your changes to all elements that share this class. 

**NOTE: The effects of using an Element class can have unintended consequences. When applying changes to an element class be aware that the changes can be applied wherever the class is applied. A change to an Element class change can cascade into multiple places on a page or even across the website. Using an Element ID or CSS Path is always unique to a specific web page.**

####

**Demo**: [Visit the NewPath Wild Apricot Sandbox in dev mode](https://newpathconsulting.wildapricot.org/?dev). Click on any element to inspect the Element ID, Element Class(es) or CSS Path.

## Installation

### Script Setup

1. In Admin View of Web Apricot, browse to Settings -&gt; Site -&gt; Global JavaScript. More details on inserting JavaScript into Wild Apricot are available in [Wild Apricot Documentation](https://gethelp.wildapricot.com/en/articles/212-inserting-and-modifying-html-or-javascript#javascript).
2. Copy and paste the following lines to the Global JavaScript.

NOTE: this code snippet assumes you have uploaded all files into the folder `/resources/Theme/WildApricotTextManager`

   ```html
   <!-- jQuery-CSV Source: https://github.com/evanplaice/jquery-csv -->
   <script src="/resources/Theme/WildApricotTextManager/jquery.csv-0.8.9-mod.js"></script>
   <script src="/resources/Theme/WildApricotTextManager/wildapricot-textmanager.js"></script>
   <script>
   var textManagerMultilingualMode = true;
   var primaryLanguageButtonName = "English";
   var alterativeLanguageButtonName = "Fran√ßais";
   var languageButtonHtmlID = "languageButton";
   var alterativeLanguageClassName = ".french";
   var primaryLanguageClassName = ".english";

   $(window).bind("load", function() {$('#textmanager_overlay').css('display', 'none'); });  // Fail-safe to remove white overlay
   </script>
   ```

3. To deactivate the multilingual mode edit this JavaScript variable declaration as follows:

   `var textManagerMultilingualMode = false;`

### Files Setup

1. In Admin view of Wild Apricot, browse to [Website -&gt; Files](https://gethelp.wildapricot.com/en/articles/177#uploading). 
2. Create a new folder named `WildApricotTextManager` under the Theme folder.

   ![File Manager in Wild Apricot](https://github.com/asirota/watm/raw/master/docs/images/files-make-new-folder.png)

3. Upload [jquery.csv-0.8.9-mod.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asirota/watm/master/WildApricotTextManager/jquery.csv-0.8.9-mod.js) to the new folder.
4. Upload [wildapricot-textmanager.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asirota/watm/master/WildApricotTextManager/wildapricot-textmanager.js) to the new folder.
5. Upload [wildapricot-textmanager-config.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asirota/watm/master/WildApricotTextManager/wildapricot-textmanager-config.csv) to the new folder. 

### Testing Installation

To test whether EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer has been installed properly:

1. Click Public View to browse the Wild Apricot website.

2. Append ?dev and hit return to reload the page. You should see the CSS class/id inspector.

2. Right click on the page and select 'Inspect'. Invoking Developer Tools may be different depending on the browser you are using.

3. Navigate to Console and look for the message in yellow below. The version number should appear. If you do not see this message, or you see errors EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer may not have been properly installed.

![WATM version message](https://github.com/asirota/watm/raw/master/docs/images/console%20watm%20version%20logging.jpg)

### Overlay Setup \(Optional\)

Normally, when the EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer is enabled, the original text is displayed on the page load and then replaced within one second. This "flicker" can be hidden with the HTML and CSS below. EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer will automatically remove the overlay once the script has been completed, reducing the flicker.

Open the each Wild Apricot Page Template in use, add a [Custom HTML](https://gethelp.wildapricot.com/en/articles/408) gadget anywhere in the template. Edit the code of the Custom HTML gadget and include this HTML snippet:

```markup
<div id="textmanager_overlay"></div>
```

You must also add these lines to the Wild Apricot global CSS in the [Website -&gt; CSS](https://gethelp.wildapricot.com/en/articles/438#entering) menu:

```css
#textmanager_overlay {
    position: fixed;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    background-color: white;
    z-index: 2;
}
```

### Multilingual Setup \(Optional\)


#### Standard WildApricot translation file

EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer can be also be used to enable 2 languages for WildApricot websites. EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer does _not_ require you to create any additional site pages or page templates. Translations can be applied for any Wild Apricot module without the need to create multiple versions of a page, event, donation form etc. A French translation file is included as sample CSV configuration file, named `FR-wildapricot-textmanager-config.csv`. Remember to rename this file to `wildapricot-textmanager-config.csv` before using it. This file can be edited in Microsoft Excel or another CSV editor. When saving the file, make sure to save with the UTF-8 encoding format to preserve any accented or multi-byte characters.

#### Moving the language switcher button

To move the Language button from the default location:
1. In Admin View, browse to each page template in use.
2. Click Edit, then Gadgets, then drag and drop Custom HTML gadget to where you would like to place the button.
3. Click Edit code and delete the default ‚ÄúInsert your HTML code here‚Äù.
4. Add a single space into the gadget. It will show empty but there will be a "placeholder" space.
5. Click Settings button for the new gadget. On the left panel, show Advanced and then change the HTML ID tp `languageButton`.
6. Save the template.
7. Repeat this for each page template.
8. \(Optional\) Customize the look of the button by applying custom CSS to the ID `#languageButton` in the configuration file on the Custom CSS section.

#### Add the translated content

The below is an example of adding translated content to a Wild Apricot "Contact" page.

1. Start with your Contact page. In Admin Mode, browse to Website -&gt; Site pages -&gt; Contact and click Edit. You may have a different page on your site, and you can start with any page.
2. Click on Gadgets and drag a new Content gadget below the existing Contact us heading. If your second language is French, then type in `Contactez nous` into this new space. Adjust font sizes and padding to match the original content.

   ![Advanced Settings in CSS](https://github.com/asirota/watm/raw/master/docs/images/contact-us-heading.png)

3. Show [Advanced settings section](https://gethelp.wildapricot.com/en/articles/187#settings) on the left settings panel and add `french` to the CSS class text box.
4. Click on the original English Contact us heading and add `english` to the CSS class text box.

![Advanced Settings in CSS](https://github.com/asirota/watm/raw/master/docs/images/advanced-english-class.png)

5. Repeat for other content blocks you wish to localize and Save page. The result should look similar to below:

![Advanced Settings in CSS for Contact Us Widgets](https://github.com/asirota/watm/raw/master/docs/images/contact-us-widgets.png)

Note that if EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer is enabled, one of the two languages will be hidden based on the state of the language, even in the Edit mode. Please make sure `textManagerProductionMode = false` is set in Global JavaScript and then click the button to disable EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer to see both sets of languages at once.

### Support for embedded WildApricot widgets on 3rd party Content Management Systems

If you are using the WildApricot widget code using iframes, use the ?secondLanguage argument at the end of widget URL to trigger translations to be loaded.

1. Alter the WildApricot widget code to support the ?secondLanguage widget.
2. Embed the widget on the translated page on the 3rd party CMS. This works with systems like Drupal, Squarespace and WordPress.

Example code:

For ENGLISH pages use the default language widget:
```html
<iframe width='750px' height='400px' frameborder='no' src='https://mysite.wildapricot.org/widget/join-us' onload='tryToEnableWACookies("https://mysite.wildapricot.org");' ></iframe>
<script  type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="https://mysite.wildapricot.org/Common/EnableCookies.js" ></script>
```

For FRENCH pages add  the ?secondLanguage widget: 
```html
<iframe width='750px' height='400px' frameborder='no' src='https://mysite.wildapricot.org/widget/join-us/?secondLanguage' onload='tryToEnableWACookies("https://mysite.wildapricot.org");' ></iframe>
<script  type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="https://mysite.wildapricot.org/Common/EnableCookies.js" ></script>
```

## EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer Configuration File

To maintain all the EZ Wild Apricot Web Designer text changes, translations and styling changes, you must edit and maintain the CSV configuration file `wildapricot-textmanager-config.csv` using Excel or another commas seperated file \(CSV\) editor.

### Instructions for editing the file in Excel

1. Open the `wildapricot-textmanager-config.csv` file Choose Delimited, check My data has headers and click Next

![Excel CSV Import Step 1](https://github.com/asirota/watm/raw/master/docs/images/excel-csv-import1.png)

2. Check Comma for the Delimiters option, Click Finish

![Excel CSV Import Step 1](https://github.com/asirota/watm/raw/master/docs/images/excel-csv-import2.png)

### Saving the configuration file

When saving the file, use the CSV UTF-8 \(Comma delimited\) \(_.csv\). \*Other formats will break the configuration file!_

The configuration file may be cached in the web browser between changes while in production mode. If you don't see your configuration file changes reflected on the website, you will need to [force-refresh your browser](https://www.wikihow.com/Force-Refresh-in-Your-Internet-Browser) to reload the latest configuration file.


### Fields in the configuration file

#### Note: Inserting or moving columns will break the configuration file!

`Wild Apricot Reference`: The field can be used to group configuration lines together in the configration file. It is for reference use only.

`Default Text`: The text that will be searched for replacement in a Wild Apricot gadget or label. This is a case-sensitive and space sensitive field.

`English Replacement Text`: If you wish to replace the text with another value, place the new text in this field. This is an optional field.

`Alternative Language Text`: If you wish to translate text with another language, place the translated language in this field. This field is an optional field.

`Notes`: Notes can be added here for reference.

`Function`: This field is used to manage text. If a function is used the `Default Text`, `English Replacement Text` and `Alternative Language Text` fields will be used. It is an optional field.

`Query`: This is the targeted CSS ID, CSS Path or CSS Style to target for changes. It is a required field.

`Style`: Contains the CSS style properties and value to apply to the `Query` element

**Note:** You can leave the `Function` field empty if you wish to apply CSS using the `Query` and `Style` fields.

### Text Management Functions for `Function` field:

The functions below change the text with the contents of `English Replacement Text` or the `Alternative Language Text` column. Any text in the `Default Text` column is ignored.

* `text` ‚Äì sets text of the element selected by the `Query` column.
* `hide` ‚Äì hides the element selected by the `Query` column.
* `button` ‚Äì sets value of the button selected by the `Query` column.
* `placeholder` ‚Äì sets placeholder attribute. Only used for search boxes.
* `delay` ‚Äì page will pause one second before replacing text. This can be used on text elements that are written with JavaScript after page load (eg the member directory gadget).

The following functions expect to use `Default Text` column as the search criteria for replacement.

* `replace` ‚Äì Searches for `Default Text` column and replaces this sub-string in any element. If `Query` column is blank, the entire page is searched. 
* `replace_element` ‚Äì Searches text in `Default Text` column and replaces the text of the entire element. If `Query` column is blank, the entire page is searched.
* `replace_delay` ‚Äì Replaces string after one second delay. Add a `_n` suffix after `replace_delay`  to increase delay beyond the default 1 second.  `replace_delay_3`will delay 3 seconds.
* `attribute` - Replaces string containted in any HTML `attribute` tag

There is a subtle difference between the `text`, `replace`/`replace_delay` and `replace_element` functions.


Function `text` ignores the `Default Text` value and simply replaces the text inside the element tht matches the `Query`. It is *not* a search/replace function.

*Example:*

If the ID is #myelement and you wish to replace the content with "Wild Apricot is awesome!" create the following configuration row:

-  `Function` is `text`
-  `Query` is `#myelement` and
-  `English Replacement Text` is `Wild Apricot is awesome!`

Functions `replace`, `replace_delay` and `replace_element` do a search & replace based on the `Default Text` field.

*Example:*

If the ID is #myelement and you wish to find the text `Personify` anywhere in an element and replace it with `Wild Apricot` create the following configuration row:

-  `Function` is `replace`
-  `Query` is `#myelement` and
-  `Default Text` is `Personify`. Make sure case is correct as the search is case-sensitive.
-  `English Replacement Text` is `Wild Apricot`

If the original text is `Personify is awesome!` the configuration above will replace the string with `Wild Apricot is awesome!`.

*Example:*

If the ID is #myelement and you wish to find the text `Personify` anywhere inside an element and replace _the whole element_ with `Wild Apricot is great!` create the following configuration row:

-  `Function` is `replace_element`
-  `Query` is `#myelement` and
-  `Default Text` is `Personify`. Make sure case is correct as the search is case-sensitive.
-  `English Replacement Text` is `Wild Apricot is great!`

If the original text is `Personify is awesome!` the configuration above will replace the element with `Wild Apricot is awesome!`. It simply searches for the the `Default Text` and when found uses the `English Replacement Text`.

The `replace_delay` function waits a preset number of seconds before making a replacement to allow any other Javascript to execute before making element changes.

In the above examples, the `English Replacement Text` can be replaced with `Alternative Language Text` if multilingual mode is turned on.


#### Utility Functions

* `inactive` ‚Äì disables the configuration row. This function can be used to save a configuration, but not activate it for use.


#### CSS-only functions:

* `mouseover` ‚Äì Sets CSS inside an event handler when hovering over an element.
* `mouseout` ‚Äì Sets CSS inside an event handler when no longer hovering over element.

`Query`: The CSS selector to target for the change. A selector can include HTML elements, classes and IDs as well as a CSS path \(eg `div.class > td > #myID`\). [Using Copy Selector and Copy Styles to quickly find a CSS Selector](https://vimeo.com/368823350)

`Style`: The CSS ruleset \(properties & values\) to apply to selector in the `Query` column. Optional.

Each property and value should be enclosed with a double quote \("\) \(eg "color":"red";\)
