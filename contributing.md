# How to Contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers and users. We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

If you haven't already, come find the user community on [Slack](https://www.newpathconsulting.com/watm). We want to work on things you're excited about.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You \(or your employer\) retain the copyright to your contribution, this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. \[Contact NewPath Consulting for a\] CLA \([https://www.newpathconsulting.com/contact-us.html](https://www.newpathconsulting.com/contact-us.html)\)

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/asirota/watm/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done \(read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)\). Please follow our coding conventions \(below\) and make sure all of your commits are atomic \(one feature per commit\).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```text
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

* We indent using two spaces \(soft tabs\)
* We try to put spaces after list items and method parameters \(`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`\), around operators \(`x += 1`, not `x+=1`\), and around hash arrows.
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks, Alex Sirota, Director, [NewPath Consulting](https://www.newpathconsulting.com)
