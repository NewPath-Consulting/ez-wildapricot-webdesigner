# SCHEDULE 1 Data Processing Agreement

## 1. Nature and purpose of the processing
This Data Processing Agreement (“DPA) is an annex to and forms an inseparable part of the Terms of Service between the Customer or you and NewPath, regarding your use of our Services.

The agreed Service delivery may include processing of personal data by NewPath and its subcontractors, on behalf of the Customer, within the scope described in the Terms of Service. The purpose of this DPA is to set the terms and conditions governing such processing by NewPath on behalf of the Customer in compliance with the requirements set by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and other applicable data protection legislation.

This DPA shall take precedence over conflicting provisions relating to processing of personal data in the Agreement, unless otherwise expressly stated in this DPA.

The parties acknowledge and agree that the Customer enters into this DPA on behalf of itself and on behalf of its affiliates which utilize the Services as defined in the Terms of Service (“Affiliates”), thereby establishing a separate DPA between NewPath and each of the Customer Affiliates subject to the terms of this DPA. The Customer and Affiliates are jointly referred to as the “Customer”.

These Data Subjects may include individuals: (a) to whom online advertising has been, or will be, directed; (b) who have visited websites, platforms, services or applications in respect of which NewPath provides the Services; and/or (c) who are customers or users (including prospective customer’s or user’s) of the Customer or Customer’s customers.

## 7. Sub-processors and transfers to third countries
### 7.1 
The Customer acknowledges that NewPath needs to engage other processors for carrying out specific processing activities and that NewPath wishes to deliver standard services to its customers in a consistent, secure and efficient manner. Accordingly, the DPA shall constitute a general authorization by the Customer for NewPaths’ use of sub-processors. NewPath shall ensure that sub-processors are bound by a written agreement that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required by NewPath under this DPA. NewPath shall inform the Customer of changes concerning its sub-processors, including the identity and location of new or replaced sub-processors. A list of sub-processors is available at NewPath’s web pages [https://www.newpathconsulting.com/privacy.html] or other location as designated by NewPath from time to time.

### 7.3
In case the Customer objects to the use of a specific sub-processor, the parties shall enter into good faith negotiations on how to resolve the issue. In case the negotiations do not solve the issue and the Customer opposes NewPath’s use of a specific sub-processor either party shall, for a justified reason and as a final remedy, be entitled to terminate the Terms of Service on thirty days’ written notice.

### 7.4
NewPath and its sub-processors may transfer or process personal data outside the EU/EEA area.

### 7.5
When transfer of personal data by NewPath to a sub-processor outside the EU/EEA, is permitted as stated above, in case of any transfer NewPath shall ensure that transfer is only made to (a) a country deemed by the Commission to have an adequate level of protection, (b) entities having committed to the EU-US Privacy Shield or having entered into the EU Commission standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union concerning the transfer of personal data to outside the EU/EEA or provided other appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR.

### 7.6
Subject to the above and subject to NewPath keeping the Customer informed of any transfer of personal data outside the EU/EEA, the Customer gives its consent to the transfers and authorizes NewPath to agree on the use of privacy clauses on behalf of the Customer and to represent the Customer regarding those conditions of the standard contractual clauses that refer to the rights and liabilities of the Customer.

## 8. Retention of your data
NewPath has no obligation to store and NewPath will not store any of your data after the termination of your account and/or subscription of the Service. NewPath will, at your choice, promptly delete or return all personal data related to you after the end of the provision of the Services relating to processing and delete existing copies unless applicable legislation requires storage of the personal data.

## 9. Audit
### 9.1
NewPath shall upon the Customer’s request make available to the Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this DPA and the GDPR.

### 9.2

The Parties shall agree on the time of the auditing and other details ahead of time and at latest 30 days before the inspection.

The parties’ (including their group companies) liability for damages under the DPA shall be limited in scope and to the double of maximum amounts set out in the Terms of Service, except when limitations of liability are expressly prohibited under the applicable legislation or are otherwise legally invalid or unenforceable. To clarify, indirect damages are excluded.
