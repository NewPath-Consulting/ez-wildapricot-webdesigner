# SCHEDULE 1 Data Processing Agreement

## 1. Nature and purpose of the processing
This Data Processing Agreement (“DPA) is an annex to and forms an inseparable part of the Terms of Service between the Customer or you and NewPath, regarding your use of our Services.

The agreed Service delivery may include processing of personal data by NewPath and its subcontractors, on behalf of the Customer, within the scope described in the Terms of Service. The purpose of this DPA is to set the terms and conditions governing such processing by NewPath on behalf of the Customer in compliance with the requirements set by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and other applicable data protection legislation.

The parties acknowledge and agree that the Customer enters into this DPA on behalf of itself and on behalf of its affiliates which utilize the Services as defined in the Terms of Service (“Affiliates”), thereby establishing a separate DPA between NewPath and each of the Customer Affiliates subject to the terms of this DPA.

## 7. Sub-processors and transfers to third countries
### 7.1 
The Customer acknowledges that NewPath needs to engage other processors for carrying out specific processing activities and that NewPath wishes to deliver standard services to its customers in a consistent, secure and efficient manner. Accordingly, the DPA shall constitute a general authorization by the Customer for NewPaths’ use of sub-processors.

### 7.4
NewPath and its sub-processors may transfer or process personal data outside the EU/EEA area.

### 7.5
When transfer of personal data by NewPath to a sub-processor outside the EU/EEA, is permitted as stated above, in case of any transfer NewPath shall ensure that transfer is only made to (a) a country deemed by the Commission to have an adequate level of protection, (b) entities having committed to the EU-US Privacy Shield or having entered into the EU Commission standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union concerning the transfer of personal data to outside the EU/EEA or provided other appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR.

The parties’ (including their group companies) liability for damages under the DPA shall be limited in scope and to the double of maximum amounts set out in the Terms of Service, except when limitations of liability are expressly prohibited under the applicable legislation or are otherwise legally invalid or unenforceable. To clarify, indirect damages are excluded.
